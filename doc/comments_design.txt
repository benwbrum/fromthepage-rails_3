Button appears on both edit and view actions of item component

Pressing "add a comment" button persists any unsaved item text to 
session and reloads the page in the same mode, but with an additional 
textarea.

Pressing "save comment" or "cancel" perform appropriate comment action 
but also persist unsaved item text to session.  User is then returned to 
edit/show view.

was in edit mode and is unsaved?
